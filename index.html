        During the pandemic, I've been keeping busy with a few different things. I started writing a novel, which has been a
        really cool way to get my ideas out there and escape into my own world for a bit. I've also been playing a bunch of
        games with my friends online. It's been a great way to stay connected and have some fun during these weird times. I have
        been taking care of my grandmother too. Lastly, I've been getting into storytelling. Learning about how to tell a good
        story has been super interesting and it's even helping me with my novel!
